# OSD volume display for Android based TV devices.
This application is using the Onkyo eISCP protocol to monitor the volume of your AV receiver. If the volume changes, a toast will be shown on your Android based TV box. Please see tested devices below.

Please add your device/OS if you have a chance to test it yourself!
